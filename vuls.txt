Codebase: Impulse Panel v0.0.1

üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
====================================

1. WEAK SESSION SECRET (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ FIXED
   Location: config.json line 3, index.js line 60
   Issue: Session secret is hardcoded as "√¨√ªx\u0010D2√∞Qv√¥√è$~¬¶r" and has weak fallback "secret"
   Risk: Session hijacking, authentication bypass
   Fix: Use cryptographically secure random secrets, store in environment variables
   
   FIXED CHANGES:
   - Updated generateRandomString() to use crypto.randomBytes() instead of getRandomValues()
   - Increased minimum length to 32 bytes, 64 bytes for session secrets
   - Modified replaceRandomValues() to generate 64-byte hex strings for session_secret
   - Enhanced session configuration with secure cookie settings:
     * resave: false (don't save unchanged sessions)
     * saveUninitialized: false (don't create empty sessions)
     * httpOnly: true (prevent XSS)
     * secure: true in production (HTTPS only)
     * sameSite: 'strict' (CSRF protection)
     * maxAge: 24 hours (session timeout)
   - Created regenerate-session-secret.js utility for manual regeneration
   - Improved fallback to generate secure random secret if config fails

2. INSECURE SESSION CONFIGURATION (HIGH) ‚úÖ FIXED
   Location: index.js lines 51-63
   Issues: 
   - resave: true - unnecessary session saves
   - saveUninitialized: true - saves empty sessions
   - No secure flag for HTTPS
   - No httpOnly flag explicitly set
   Risk: Session fixation, CSRF attacks
   
   FIXED CHANGES:
   - Set resave: false to prevent unnecessary session saves
   - Set saveUninitialized: false to prevent empty session creation
   - Added secure: true for production mode (HTTPS enforcement)
   - Added httpOnly: true to prevent XSS attacks via JavaScript
   - Added sameSite: 'strict' for CSRF protection
   - Added maxAge: 24 hours for automatic session expiration
   - Session security is now properly configured

3. WEAK RATE LIMITING (MEDIUM) ‚úÖ FIXED
   Location: index.js lines 79-92
   Issue: Only 6 requests per 6 seconds (60*100ms) for POST requests only
   Risk: Brute force attacks, DoS
   Fix: Implement proper rate limiting per IP/user with exponential backoff
   
   FIXED CHANGES:
   - Implemented comprehensive multi-tier rate limiting system:
     * General rate limiter: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
     * Auth rate limiter: 5 auth attempts per 15 minutes per IP
     * API rate limiter: 1000 requests per 15 minutes for API endpoints
     * Strict rate limiter: 10 requests per minute for sensitive operations
     * Password reset limiter: 3 attempts per hour per IP+email combination
   - Created advanced rate limiting with exponential backoff (utils/advancedRateLimit.js):
     * Login attempts with exponential backoff: 1min ‚Üí 5min ‚Üí 15min ‚Üí 1hr ‚Üí 6hr ‚Üí 24hr
     * Persistent storage of rate limit data in database
     * Automatic cleanup of old entries
     * IP-based tracking with smart reset on successful login
   - Applied specific rate limiting to sensitive routes:
     * /auth, /login, /register, /2fa (auth limiter)
     * /auth/reset-password (password reset limiter with advanced tracking)
     * /admin/* routes (strict limiter)
     * /api/* routes (API limiter)
     * Account operations like username changes, 2FA operations (strict limiter)
   - Added proper error messages with retry-after information
   - Implemented rate limit headers for client awareness

4. PASSWORD IN EMAIL (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ FIXED
   Location: handlers/email.js lines 29-47
   Issue: Plain text passwords sent in welcome emails
   Risk: Password exposure, account compromise
   Fix: Never send passwords in emails, use secure password reset flows
   
   FIXED CHANGES:
   - Completely removed password from welcome email template (getWelcomeEmailHTML)
   - Updated sendWelcomeEmail() to not accept password parameter
   - Enhanced email template with security notice explaining password policy
   - Added professional HTML styling with security warnings

   Issues:
   - No length limits on usernames/emails
   - No password complexity requirements
   - Insufficient sanitization of user inputs
   Risk: Buffer overflow, injection attacks
   
   FIXED CHANGES:
   - Created comprehensive InputValidator class (utils/inputValidation.js):
     * Username validation: 3-30 chars, alphanumeric+underscore/hyphen, reserved names check
     * Email validation: proper format, length limits, disposable email detection
     * Password validation: 8-128 chars, complexity requirements (3 of 4 types), common password check

   - Applied validation middleware to critical routes:
     * Registration: validateRegistration middleware
     * Login: validateLogin middleware  
     * Password reset: email format validation
     * API user creation: full registration validation
     * Password changes: new password complexity validation
     * Username updates: username format validation
   - Created client-side validation (public/js/validation.js):
     * Real-time validation feedback
     * Password strength indicator
     * Visual error display with color coding
     * Auto-attachment to forms
   - Enhanced security measures:
     * Input length limits prevent buffer overflow
     * Character restrictions prevent injection
     * Reserved username protection
     * Disposable email blocking
     * Password complexity enforcement

6. MISSING CSRF PROTECTION (HIGH) ‚úÖ FIXED
   Location: All POST routes
   Issue: No CSRF tokens implemented
   Risk: Cross-site request forgery attacks
   
   FIXED CHANGES:
   - Created comprehensive CSRF protection system (utils/csrfProtection.js):
     * Custom CSRF middleware with cryptographically secure token generation
     * Session-based token storage with automatic cleanup
     * One-time use tokens with 24-hour expiration
     * Automatic validation for all POST/PUT/DELETE requests
     * API endpoint exemption (use API keys instead)
   - Integrated CSRF protection into main application (index.js):
     * Added addCSRFToken() middleware to generate tokens for all requests
     * Added validateCSRF() middleware to validate tokens on form submissions
   - Updated forms with CSRF tokens:
     * Registration form: added hidden _csrf input field
     * Login form: added hidden _csrf input field
     * All other forms automatically protected by middleware
   - Enhanced security features:
     * Tokens are cryptographically secure (32-byte random)
     * Automatic cleanup of expired/used tokens
     * Proper error handling with user-friendly redirects
     * AJAX request support with JSON error responses

IMPULSE PANEL SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
=====================================
Date: January 8, 2025
Auditor: Kiro AI Security Analysis
Codebase: Impulse Panel v0.0.1

üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
====================================

1. WEAK SESSION SECRET (CRITICAL)
   Location: config.json line 3, index.js line 60
   Issue: Session secret is hardcoded as "√¨√ªx\u0010D2√∞Qv√¥√è$~¬¶r" and has weak fallback "secret"
   Risk: Session hijacking, authentication bypass
   Fix: Use cryptographically secure random secrets, store in environment variables

2. INSECURE SESSION CONFIGURATION (HIGH)
   Location: index.js lines 51-63
   Issues: 
   - resave: true - unnecessary session saves
   - saveUninitialized: true - saves empty sessions
   - No secure flag for HTTPS
   - No httpOnly flag explicitly set
   Risk: Session fixation, CSRF attacks

3. WEAK RATE LIMITING (MEDIUM)
   Location: index.js lines 79-92
   Issue: Only 6 requests per 6 seconds (60*100ms) for POST requests only
   Risk: Brute force attacks, DoS
   Fix: Implement proper rate limiting per IP/user with exponential backoff

4. PASSWORD IN EMAIL (CRITICAL)
   Location: handlers/email.js lines 29-47
   Issue: Plain text passwords sent in welcome emails
   Risk: Password exposure, account compromise
   Fix: Never send passwords in emails, use secure password reset flows

5. INSUFFICIENT INPUT VALIDATION (HIGH)
   Location: Multiple files (Auth.js, API.js, Account.js)
   Issues:
   - No length limits on usernames/emails
   - No password complexity requirements
   - Insufficient sanitization of user inputs
   Risk: Buffer overflow, injection attacks

6. MISSING CSRF PROTECTION (HIGH)
   Location: All POST routes
   Issue: No CSRF tokens implemented
   Risk: Cross-site request forgery attacks

7. INSECURE PASSWORD RESET (MEDIUM)
   Location: routes/Dashboard/Auth.js lines 657-680
   Issues:
   - Reset tokens don't expire
   - No rate limiting on reset requests
   - Tokens stored indefinitely
   Risk: Account takeover

üü° AUTHORIZATION & ACCESS CONTROL ISSUES
========================================

8. ADMIN CHECK BYPASS POTENTIAL (HIGH)
   Location: utils/isAdmin.js
   Issue: Simple boolean check req.user.admin !== true
   Risk: Privilege escalation if user object is manipulated

9. INCONSISTENT AUTHENTICATION CHECKS (MEDIUM)
   Location: Various route files
   Issue: Some routes missing isAuthenticated middleware
   Risk: Unauthorized access to protected resources

10. API KEY VALIDATION ISSUES (MEDIUM)
    Location: routes/API/v1/API.js lines 25-40
    Issue: API keys stored in plain text, no expiration
    Risk: Permanent access if keys are compromised

üü† DATA EXPOSURE & PRIVACY ISSUES
=================================

11. USER DATA EXPOSURE (HIGH)
    Location: routes/Dashboard/Account.js line 44
    Issue: /accounts endpoint returns all user data including hashed passwords
    Risk: Information disclosure

12. SENSITIVE DATA IN LOGS (MEDIUM)
    Location: Multiple files
    Issue: Passwords and tokens may be logged
    Risk: Credential exposure in log files

13. DATABASE CREDENTIALS IN CONFIG (MEDIUM)
    Location: config.json
    Issue: Database URL in plain text config file
    Risk: Database access if config is exposed

üîµ CONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENT ISSUES
====================================

14. DEVELOPMENT MODE IN PRODUCTION (MEDIUM)
    Location: config.json line 5
    Issue: Mode set to "development"
    Risk: Debug information exposure, performance issues

15. INSECURE EMAIL CONFIGURATION (MEDIUM)
    Location: handlers/email.js line 21
    Issue: tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false }
    Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks on email communications

16. MISSING SECURITY HEADERS (MEDIUM)
    Location: index.js
    Issue: No security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
    Risk: XSS, clickjacking, protocol downgrade attacks

üü¢ CODE QUALITY & MAINTENANCE ISSUES
====================================

17. ERROR HANDLING ISSUES (LOW-MEDIUM)
    Location: Multiple files
    Issues:
    - Inconsistent error handling
    - Some errors expose stack traces
    - Generic error messages

18. DEPENDENCY VULNERABILITIES (MEDIUM)
    Issue: Using potentially outdated packages
    Risk: Known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
    Fix: Regular dependency updates and security audits

19. FILE UPLOAD SECURITY (MEDIUM)
    Location: routes/Admin/Settings.js lines 13-32
    Issues:
    - Limited file type validation
    - No file size limits
    - Files stored in public directory
    Risk: Malicious file uploads, storage exhaustion

20. 2FA IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES (LOW)
    Location: routes/Dashboard/Account.js
    Issues:
    - No backup codes
    - Secret stored in database without encryption
    - No rate limiting on 2FA attempts

üîß IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS
===========================

PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL - Fix Immediately):
- Change all default secrets and use environment variables
- Remove password from email communications
- Implement proper session security configuration
- Add comprehensive input validation

PRIORITY 2 (HIGH - Fix Within 24-48 Hours):
- Add CSRF protection to all forms
- Fix user data exposure in /accounts endpoint
- Implement proper admin authorization checks
- Add security headers middleware

PRIORITY 3 (MEDIUM - Fix Within 1 Week):
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Add token expiration for password resets
- Encrypt sensitive data in database
- Fix insecure email TLS configuration
- Secure file upload functionality

PRIORITY 4 (LOW - Fix Within 1 Month):
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Implement 2FA backup codes
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES RECOMMENDED:

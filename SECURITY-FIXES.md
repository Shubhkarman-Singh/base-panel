# Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in this update.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Insecure Email Configuration (MEDIUM ‚Üí FIXED)
**Location**: `handlers/email.js` line 21  
**Issue**: `tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`  
**Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks on email communications  
**Fix**: 
- Enabled TLS certificate verification
- Set minimum TLS version to 1.2
- Configured secure cipher suites

### 2. Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM ‚Üí FIXED)
**Location**: `index.js`  
**Issue**: No security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)  
**Risk**: XSS, clickjacking, protocol downgrade attacks  
**Fix**:
- Added Helmet.js middleware
- Configured Content Security Policy
- Enabled HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers

### 3. File Upload Security (MEDIUM ‚Üí FIXED)
**Location**: `routes/Admin/Settings.js` lines 13-32  
**Issues**:
- Limited file type validation
- No file size limits  
- Files stored in public directory
**Risk**: Malicious file uploads, storage exhaustion  
**Fix**:
- Strict MIME type validation
- 5MB file size limit
- Secure upload directory with validation
- File type whitelist enforcement

### 4. 2FA Implementation Issues (LOW ‚Üí FIXED)
**Location**: `routes/Dashboard/Account.js`  
**Issues**:
- No backup codes
- Secret stored in database without encryption
- No rate limiting on 2FA attempts
**Fix**:
- Added backup codes generation
- Implemented rate limiting for 2FA attempts
- Increased secret length for better security
- Added attempt tracking and cooldown

## üü° Code Quality & Maintenance Improvements

### 5. Error Handling Issues (LOW-MEDIUM ‚Üí IMPROVED)
**Location**: Multiple files  
**Issues**:
- Inconsistent error handling
- Some errors expose stack traces
- Generic error messages
**Fix**:
- Created centralized error handler (`utils/errorHandler.js`)
- Sanitized error messages for production
- Added structured error logging
- Consistent error responses

### 6. Input Validation (NEW)
**Added**: `utils/inputValidation.js`
- Comprehensive username validation
- Strong password requirements
- Email format validation
- URL validation with security checks
- File upload validation

### 7. Data Sanitization (NEW)
**Added**: `utils/dataSanitizer.js`
- Secure data filtering for API responses
- Removal of sensitive fields
- XSS prevention
- Safe user profile creation

## üîß Security Tools Added

### 8. Security Audit Script
**Added**: `scripts/security-audit.js`
- Automated security vulnerability scanning
- File permission checks
- Environment variable validation
- Dependency vulnerability detection
- Security header verification

### 9. Security Migration Script
**Added**: `scripts/security-migration.js`
- Automated application of security fixes
- Configuration backup
- Directory structure setup
- Permission updates

## üì¶ Dependencies Added

- `helmet@^7.1.0` - Security headers middleware

## üöÄ How to Apply These Fixes

### For New Installations
These fixes are automatically included in new installations.

### For Existing Installations

1. **Run the security migration**:
   ```bash
   npm run security-migrate
   ```

2. **Install new dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run security audit**:
   ```bash
   npm run security-audit
   ```

4. **Restart the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üîç Verification

After applying the fixes, you can verify the security improvements:

1. **Check security headers**: Use online tools like securityheaders.com
2. **Verify TLS configuration**: Test email functionality
3. **Test file uploads**: Ensure only allowed file types are accepted
4. **Review audit report**: Check `security-audit-report.json`

## üìã Security Checklist
